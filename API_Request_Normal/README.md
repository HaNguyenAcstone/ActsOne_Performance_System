**Import Statements:**

- `requests`: Essential for making HTTP requests to the specified URLs.
- `time`: Used to measure the time taken for each request execution.

**`make_request` Function:**

- **Purpose:** Executes an HTTP GET request to a given URL, measures execution time, retrieves and analyzes response information.
- **Parameters:**
    - `url`: The URL of the endpoint you wish to make a request to.
- **Improvements:**
    - Clearer comments to explain each step.
    - Error handling to gracefully handle potential request failures (`requests.exceptions.RequestException`).
    - Enhanced formatting for readability.
- **Code:**

```python
import time
import requests

def make_request(url):
    """
    Executes a GET request to the specified URL, measures the execution time,
    and prints results including response status code, content size, and response text.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL of the endpoint to make the request to.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    start_time = time.time()

    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for non-2xx status codes

        end_time = time.time()

        print("Thời gian hoàn thành yêu cầu:", end_time - start_time, "giây")

        content_size_kb = len(response.content) / 1024
        print("Dung lượng của yêu cầu:", content_size_kb, "KB")
        print("Kết quả trả về:", response.text)

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Yêu cầu không thành công: {e}")
```

**`request_lv_1`, `request_lv_2`, and `request_lv_3` Functions:**

- **Purpose:** These functions iterate a specified number of times (`qty`) and make requests to different URLs using the `make_request` function.
- **Parameters:**
    - `qty`: The number of times to repeat the request.
- **Improvements:**
    - Explanatory descriptions for each level to enhance understanding.
- **Code:**

```python
def request_lv_1(qty):
    """
    Makes a specified number of requests to the level 1 endpoint.

    Args:
        qty (int): The number of requests to execute.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    for i in range(qty):
        url = "http://192.168.2.39:30000/just_send_request"
        make_request(url)

def request_lv_2(qty):
    """
    Makes a specified number of requests to the level 2 endpoint.

    Args:
        qty (int): The number of requests to execute.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    for i in range(qty):
        url = "http://192.168.2.39:30000/not_save_message"
        make_request(url)

def request_lv_3(qty):
    """
    Makes a specified number of requests to the level 3 endpoint,
    appending a unique client ID to the request query string.

    Args:
        qty (int): The number of requests to execute.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    for i in range(qty):
        url = f"http://192.168.2.39:5000/save_message?get=2&text=Client{i}"

```

**Explanation of Request Levels:**

Without access to the specific server implementations at `http://192.168.2.39:30000` and `http://192.168.2.39:5000`, it's difficult to provide definitive explanations. However, based on the function names and parameters, we can make some educated guesses:

- **Level 1 (just_send_request):** This endpoint likely performs minimal processing and returns a quick response.
- **Level 2 (not_save_message):** This endpoint might receive the request but not persist or store the message content.
- **Level 3 (save_message):** This endpoint
