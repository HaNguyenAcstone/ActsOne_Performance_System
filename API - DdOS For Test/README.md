DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service. It's a type of cyber attack where multiple compromised computer systems, often infected with malware, are used to target a single system or network. The aim of a DDoS attack is to overwhelm the targeted system with a flood of traffic, rendering it unable to function properly and denying service to legitimate users. These attacks can disrupt websites, online services, or entire networks, causing significant financial and reputational damage to the targeted organization.
